# 📝 How to contribute

I'm really happy that you are interested to help me on the project.
You have many ways to help me :

## 🚩 Testing :

I'm developping the software alone for now, I don't specially spend so much time on testing the software.
So, if you want to help me by testing the software and by reporting any bugs, issues you found; your help
will be really appreciated. 

## 🧤 Suggestion :

If you think that some features could be improved or if you think that some new features would be really interesting to add,
don't hesitate to suggest them to me.

## 💻 Coding :

You think that some part of the software could be added or improved, and you feel quite comfortable to code them ?
Don't hesitate to contact me.
