> Let's see the execution of an example :
> 
> | <ol type="1"><li> First of all, it changes the background with the Forest Scene. </li><li> Then we arrive in a if function. We see that the condition is equal to true. So we execute functions in it. </li><li> We play the music Nyancat. </li><li> Then we have a delay of 3 seconds. Even if there is no function after the delay in the **if block**. The delay will take effect and we will leave the **if block** only after 3 seconds. </li><li> After the 3 seconds delay, the background is changed with the mountain scene asset. </li></ul> | ![Scripting Panel](scripts/docimg_exampleDelay.jpg) |
